# 1. Introduction

This document provides documentation and keep track of changes for the database model, interfaces, and design of the software. 

- Revision 1: Created the base design of the software

# 2. Software Design

(**Note**: For all subsections of Section-2: You should describe the design for the end product (completed application) - not only your iteration1 version. You will revise this document and add more details later.)

## 2.1 Database Model

Brief descriptions of the tables in the database model: 

1. User Table
    - This table stores the common users' data of both instructor and student, such as login informationa and contact information
    - The table also have a role collumn to indicate if the user is a student or an instructor
2. Student Table
    - This table stores the specfic data of students such as GPA and major, and inherits from User
3. Instructor Table
    - This table stores the instructor's relationship with other tables, and inherits from User
3. Course Table
    - This table stores the predefined courses such as course number and title
4. Section Table
    - This table stores the sections of the courses, and serves as the SA postitions listing
    - The table has relationship with instructor that teaches the section and the course
    - Stores required qualifications that have values (ex: min GPA requires an integer)
5. Served_SA Table
    - This table signifies the relationship of Students with Courses that they have served as SA before
    - The table stores the primary keys which linked the many-to-many relationship
6. Application Table
    - This table stores the applications made by students and can be approves by instructors
    - Each application is related to a section.
7. Qualification Table
    - This table stores the qualifications that is required to be SA in a section
    - Different from the qualifications stored in Section, this table does not store values (ex: "has SA experience before", "has SA this course before")
8. Require_Qual Table
    - This table signifies the relationship of Sections requires Qualifications
    - The table stores the primary keys which linked the many-to-many relationship

## 2.2 Subsystems and Interfaces

### 2.2.1 Overview

Describe the high-level architecture of your software:  i.e., the major subsystems and how they fit together. Provide a UML component diagram that illustrates the architecture of your software. Briefly mention the role of each subsystem in your architectural design. Please refer to the "System Level Design" lectures in Week 4. 

The major subsystems:
1. Client: the user that is interacting with the system
2. Student: stores the templates, routes, and forms for student's interfaces.
    - The student subsystem is isolated from the instructor
3. Instructor: stores the templates, routes, and forms for the instructor's interfaces
    - The instructor subsystem is isolated from the student
4. Authentication: stores the templates, routes, and forms for the authetication process
    - Can route the client to either the student or the instructor's interfaces depends on the role
5. Errors Handlers: stores the templates and routes for the errors
    - Errors that happened in subsystem Student, Instructor, or Authentication get redirected to here
6. Models: stores the database models and relationships
7. PostgreSQL DB: stores the data for the models using SQLAlchemy

# Appendix: Grading Rubric
(Please remove this part in your final submission)

 * You will first  submit a draft version of this document:
    * "Project 3 : Project Design Document - draft" (5pts). 
* We will provide feedback on your document and you will revise and update it.
    * "Project 5 : Project Design Document - final" (80pts) 

Below is the grading rubric that we will use to evaluate the final version of your document. 

|**MaxPoints**| **Design** |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           | Are all parts of the document in agreement with the product requirements? |

| 8        | Is the database model (i.e., [2.1 Database Model](#21-database-model)) explained well with sufficient detail? Do the team clearly explain the purpose of each table included in the model?| 
|          | Is the document making good use of semi-formal notation (i.e., UML diagrams)? Does the document provide a clear UML class diagram visualizing the DB model of the system? |
| 18        | Is the UML class diagram complete? Does it include all classes (tables) and does it clearly mark the PK and FKs for each table? Does it clearly show the associations between them? Are the multiplicities of the associations shown correctly? ([2.1 Database Model](#21-database-model)) |

|           | **Clarity** |
|           | Is the solution at a fairly consistent and appropriate level of detail? Is the solution clear enough to be turned over to an independent group for implementation and still be understood? |
| 5         | Is the document carefully written, without typos and grammatical errors?  |
| 3         | Is the document well formatted? (Make sure to check your document on GitHub. You will loose points if there are formatting issues in your document.  )  |
